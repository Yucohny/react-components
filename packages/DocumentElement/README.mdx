import { Canvas, Meta } from '@storybook/blocks'
import * as DocumentElementStories from './src/DocumentElement.stories'

## Introduction

Provides a declarative way to specify `document.documentElement` attributes in a single-page app.

This component can be used on server side (but won't produce any effect).

Built with [React Side Effect](https://github.com/gaearon/react-side-effect).

Inspired by [React Document Title](https://github.com/gaearon/react-document-title).

## Features

- Can be defined in many places throughout the application;
- Supports arbitrary levels of nesting, so you can set app-wide and page-specific
  class name or style to `document.documentElement`;
- Works just as well with isomorphic apps.

## Properties

<Meta of={DocumentElementStories} />

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={DocumentElementStories.BasicUsage} />
