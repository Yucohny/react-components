## Usage

### `useAsync`

A hook to load data/do asynchronous operations.

Will call function once component mounted, once deps changed:

- will re-call function;
- will re-generate `reRun` function.

<Canvas of={useAsyncStories.BasicUsage} />

### `useAsyncFn`

A hook to load data/do asynchronous operations.

Will **not** call function automatically, once deps changed:

- will **not** re-call function;
- will re-generate `reRun` function.

<Canvas of={useAsyncFnStories.BasicUsage} />
